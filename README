Your first task is to complete the implementation of the camera_stream module.

Once you have done this (with reasonable confidence that it is correct),
you should generate your bitstream and export your design to the SDK.

From the SDK, you will:

1. Create a new hardware platform specification.
    File > New > Xilinx Hardware Platform Specification
    Give the project an appropriate name
    In Target Hardware Specification, browse to the "hw" directory, and choose "system.xml"

2. Create a new board support package.
    File > New > Xilinx Board Support Package
    Give the project an appropriate name
    Click Finish, then the Board Support Package Settings window appears
    Check the box for the lwip140 libraries.

3. Create a new Xilinx C project
    File > New > Xilinx C Project
    Give the project an appropriate name
    Use the Peripheral Tests template
    Click Next
    Select "Target an existing Board Support Package"
    using the bsp you created in step 2


Your edits will occur in testperiph.c (feel free to rename this file if you want).

An example version of this file (with extra #includes that you will need) is called lab2_main.c.

You can use the terminal in the same way that you did in lab 1 to read input.
Note that you should now be using the 9600 baud setting, rather than 115200. You can
reconfigure this in XPS if you want to, but there is no particular reason to.
Just make sure the settings match, otherwise you won't see any output on the terminal.
